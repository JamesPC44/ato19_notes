## Notes

- Everyone wants to write docs
- No one does it

### Technical Debt

- bad utilization of resources
- hinders team progress

### What causes tech debt?

- Developers
- Not saying no to features
- Not speaking up about unrealistic deadlines
- Time crunch
  - "I'll come back and fix it later" never happens
- Unnecessary complexity
- "It's already bad, no one will notice making it worse"

### Indicators

- Code smells
  - half-finished features
- Commented-out code
- Few or no tests

### Infrastructure smells

- Built on pile of cards
- Not modified in ages
- Everything is always on fire
- Pipeline jungles that are hard to detangle
  - Hard when moving things into destruction

- Which is hardest?
  - Burning everything <-
  - Refactor
  - Change work culture

- Which is most impactful?
  - Burning everything
  - Refactor
  - Change work culture <-

### Story Time

- Run into a wizard at ATO who gives you a present
- You have to put it together without instructions
- Some pieces are missing, some don't fit, some look right but are run
- So you build your own pieces and some don't work
- You end up miserable all the time

Wizard is a company, pieces are code, present is product

### Solution

1. Write the docs
2. Don't allow features to be completed until the docs are done
3. Write as if your best friend is reading

Critical fixes have been found through documenting code!
  - makes you think about how things actually work

### commenting vs docs

#### docs

- explain feature
  - use cases
  - recommended tooling
  - gotchas

If you have trouble documenting a function, maybe refactor the code.

### Suggestions

- Table of contents
- Further reading
- Make it easy/fun to write docs

Docs are just as much a part of a project as everything else.
