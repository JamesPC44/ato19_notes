Postgres Planner
* SQL -> Parser -> Query Tree -> Planner -> Plan Tree -> Execution
* Can turn on Query tree with debug switch
* If query is ‘perfect’ and not getting planned performance
 * Make sure plan retains semantic correctness)
 * Don’t inhibit downstream optimizations
  * Output of one should flow into results of other
* Perform your join first on the smallest tableset 
* Preprocess_explanation - 
* Can add preprocessing optimizations prior to plan execution
* Testing available to ensure pre-processing change doesn’t impact other queries?
 * No.  Large sets of queries to show results consistency but nothing actually can compare all the query plans in each test to ensure equivalenc
