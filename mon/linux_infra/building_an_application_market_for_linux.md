# ATO19: Building an Application Market for Linux

*Siram Ramkrishna*

https://allthingsopen.org/talk/building-an-application-market-for-linux/

## A Vibrant App Market Means...
- More choices in software.
- Better tools (autoconf is a nightmare)
- Greater influence in the market.
- Attracts more volunteers.
- Diversity.

## Better Tools!
- Lower the bar of entry.
- There's too much to learn! (Too many dependencies to have to learn for every technology.)
- Setting up a project.
- Arcane tools that have poor interaction.

## Greater influence
- Creates choices in software and tools.
- Kernel -- more hardware support and kernel development.
- Better software support on Linux for peripherals.
- Drive conformity within the ecosystem.
- More corporate and government investment in the ecosystem.

## Diversity
- Want racial and gender diversity.
- No metrics exist on who writes apps for Linux.
- Vibrant ecosystem can improve diversity levels.

## Where are we at?

## Containerized Apps
- New paradigm
- 2 major technologies:
    - Flatpak
    - Snapcraft
- Change from distro-centric to app-centric model.
    - Very political choice.
    - Distro-based app review doesn't scale.
    - Distros are unhappy to lose control.
    - Bug tracking woes (bugs spread across multiple distro trackers).

## Contribution Model
- Flatpak
    - Runtime + SDK
    - Runtime: Everything needed to *run* an app.
    - SDK: Everything needed to *build* an app.
    - More importantly, stuff stays *consistent* across distros.

## Distribution Model
- Target a runtime, **not** an OS.
- Easier QA on upgrades of version.

## Compensation Models
- Need to exist!
- Missed transcribing any other points on the slide.

## Gatekeeper/Apple Model
- App store as a filter of quality.
- Payment goes to:
    - Project / business
    - Appstore owner

## Direct Compensation Model
- App store as conduit to projects.
- Provides analytics to projects.

## Social Changes
- Call to arms.
- Build collaborative relationships.
- GNOME and KDE: working together on app ecosystem.
- Need participation from dropbox, electron, and others, to make things better.
- Want to pressure companies and others to join.

## Observations
- Analytics drive how popular a market is.
- Possible to measure popularity and strength of the market.
- Can trust source-available stuff.
- Success begets success.
- How to handle success is crucial.

## Questions
> "How are distros resisting the changes?"
- Answer: OS's have built their own specific runtimes.

> "Can the two models (OS-centric and app-centric) coexist?"
- Answer: Sorta.

> "What are the upcoming features for Flatpak?"
- Answer: Payments, and maybe more containerization stuff?

> "Unexpected uses of Flatpak?"
- Answer: Apparently, some folks have used Flatpak to package pirated Windows applications with Wine, which is wild.
