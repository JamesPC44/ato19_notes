## Brief history of FOSS

Every FOSS project will have leaders that eventually need to move on. Business
definition for succession planning is insufficient, doesn't address community
nature and skills. Avoid a power vaccumm - plan for succession and prevent
confusion and uncoordinated expectations.

Prevent small bus factor, be able to handle multiple human failures. By
developing talent and honing future leaders, burnout can be reduced in current
leaders. Having a succession plan will both motivate new members and
demonstrates maturity to prospective companies that may want to use your
product.

Truly meritocratic

* Normally, this leads to echo chambers and hostility to new members
* Need a mentoring program and structure, have to be able to define *merit*

## Why not have a SP?

* busy
	* likely the logic of people not bitten by someone crucial dropping out
* Don't want that workload
	* negative feelings
	* community management, not technical
* Attitude of current leaders
	* Personally tied to project
* Didn't know where to start

## How to start

* Current Leaders
	* Don't work on this in isolation; work on this together and publicly
		* take feedback
		* Don't get too many people involved
	* Identify critical roles
		* Role != Person
		* get the person performing the role to help with enumerating
		  the responsibilities
	* Consider limiting tenure for some roles
		* Ensure hand-off practice
		* Light at end of tunnel for current role-holder
		* Trains people to step in at time of need
* Knowledge transfer
	* docs are bad
	* governance is worse
	* credentials
		* prevent having one person with all passwords
	* document architectural decisions
		have history for weird/non-obvious decisions
	* inside jokes
		* people feel left out - and then leave
		* document these
	* Document all these things!
		* Include an abstract that people might actually need
* Look for opportunities to learn and contribute
* Ask for mentorships
* Ask for feedback
* Be the Homer of your project
	* capture old stories
	* document posterity

## Good examples

* Exercism
* Vox Pupuli
