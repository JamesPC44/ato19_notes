## Notes

- Education system _encourages_ automation - we are educating like machines

### Why games?

- Collateral learning - learn other topics at the same time
  - other approaches to solve problem
  - experience without consequences
  - feel responsible
- Diversion: LARPing forces you to learn about the characters
  - used to learn about events in history
  - understand factors behind decisions

### Flow theory

- Challenge engages students
  - Slightly higher than their skill levels
- Examples
  - Cytosis: teach about the cell
  - Ion
  - Peptide
  - etc.

### Why isn't it being used?

- Games are expensive ($30+
- Designing a game is difficult and time-consuming

### How to create a game?

- Premises
  - Objectives
  - Resources
  - Challenges (Universal Evil) - simplifies future choices
  - Crises
- Storyline
  - Characters
  - Objective alone is not enough - need lessons within the game
- Cooperative games work very well in educational context
  - work as a team
  - achieve a shared goal
- Mechanics and gameplay
  - Actions
  - Common mechanics:
    - Cards
    - Grids
    - Dice
    - Storytelling
    - worker action (??)
  - Balancing actions
    - No 'hunter is OP'
    - Even boss should be balanced
    - 'Hypgeomdist' - looks like an Excel thing, hypergeometric distribution
- Diversity and inclusion testing
  - encourage students to speak up and participate
  - **want students to not feel intimidated**
  - empathize with teammates
  - don't want students to give up on talking (e.g. because interrupted)
- Open Standards
  - GitHub is excellent for collaboration
    - Lots of PRs (everyone has different skills)
  - MOOCs, OERs are missing interactivity
- Print and Play should be accessible
  - A4, preferably little color
  - simple tokens, not the crazy expensive Scythe things
    - should be able to use things in your kitchen
- Open License
  - Recommended: CC NCSA 4.0

#### Extended Example

- Photosynthesis
  - Resources: Chlorophyll, Water, Sunlight, ...
  - Goal: food for the tree
  - Storyline

## Questions

- Math?
  - logic games
  - puzzle games
  - sandboxing games
  - competitive games favor certain demographics
  - all the balancing takes math
  - Set game `https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Set_(card_game)`
